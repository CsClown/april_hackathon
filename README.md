# Women's Health April Hybrid Hackathon 

## Introduction

Problem statement:
- As a woman, I find that many aspects of my health, especially sensitive or less-discussed topics, are often overlooked or not openly addressed. This leaves me feeling uninformed and unsupported when facing health challenges that are specific to women. I want a safe, welcoming space where I can find reliable information, connect with others experiencing similar issues, and engage in meaningful discussions about women's health.

ConnectHer is designed to provide an environment where women can share experiences and find information on little discussed female health issues.
Each forum will contain a link to appropriate medical information as well as giving women the opportunity to share anecdotes, personal experiences and advice.
